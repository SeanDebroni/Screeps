Spam Upgrader rooms
  overwrites normal extension flag. So, has to handle that code as well.


blueprint code - make a new blueprint just for these. pass both ext/new blueprint.

Precalc path.

Make cost Matrix. if dist >4 cost = inf. else, cost = 1; (will be all roaded).

Start bottom left. Go to top left. go to top right. go to bottom right. go to bottom left.

After each step set the positions in the path to inf. Last step set range = 1;

save path, pathlength. pathlength will be used in making the new upgraders. need to be able to do pathlength-5 moves without running out of energy.

Roles
  upgradeDancer - make from both supporting rooms. total number set, dont care what homeroom is.
    -moves in a path around the controller, upgrading every tick
    -refills from containers/storage at set points on the path.

    has in memory. a path of directions, a current step on path, last tick fatigue.

    check if moved. Use fatigue I guess? if fatigue > last tick fatigue. if not, dont advance path.
    Roads on path.

  EnergyTransferer - make from both supporting rooms. however, only have to go to/from one room?. Move terminal in supporting room to as close as possible.
                        have flag be RC-000x-P-W32E53 ? ugly. RC-000x-P-000x. but i dont have access to that in the rc func. maybe pass whole RC and reduce it asap?

    -fills from home room
    -fills structures in work room.


  Hauler - adjust hauler to not steal from upgrader container
    new mem flag - creep.memory.pickupFromContainers
                set to true Baseline
                false if in one of these rooms.
    will not look for containers if flag is false.

  builder - at least 1
  repairman - not sure how many needed, but some.
    only from main supply room.
    ONLY REPAIR CONTAINERS.

General thoughts

1 storage
5 container

wall around the path, to prevent pathfinding.

one refill stretch by path. pitstop?




















Step 0: Hauler assignment. DONE WAITING ON DEBUG.
Haulers given strict jobs to prioritize first? (each one to a source?)
Given a source.
if(no living assigned harvester) Looks around that source for any harvester creeps; assign to that one. (drive by source issues?) look at harvester task
looks at the harvesters square first for dropped energy
if nothing, looks at assigned work room for energy
creep.memory.assignedHarvesterName
creep.memory.assignedSourceID


Step 1 - Give creeps rooms to work/live in. Make code not rely on what room the creep is currently in. // DONE

Give every creep 2 things in memory

creep.memory.homeRoom - This is the room that their associated base is located.
This is used to return energy too.
This is used to pull energy from for building and upgrading.

creep.memory.workRoom - This is the room that they go to do their job in.
This is used to harvest energy in by harvesters.
This is used to pickup droppedEnergy from haulers.
This is used to go to to build in, if assigned.
This is used to go to to upgrade in, if assigned.

This is used to go to to claim, if assigned.

!!!
Refactor all creeps references to rooms to take this into account. // DONE
!!!


Make a util function to get room from name. If doesn't exist default to current creep room. //DONE


Step 1.5 Cachefind to work with multiple rooms to look in.  // I THINK THAT THIS IS UNNEEDED AND WILL BE HANDLED IN LATER REVIEW.

refactor cacheFind to allow for putting in arrays of rooms.


step 1.75

Make creeps check workRoom for structures to get energy from/fill before hoomroom.
This would be builders, upgraders, haulers\


#######################     ABOVE IS FINISHED ############################################

step 1.8


((((ceil((1*50)/x))*x) / ((ceil((1*50)/x))+2))*1500)/((x*100+1*50)+((((ceil((1*50)/x))*x) / ((ceil((1*50)/x))+2))*1500))

make spawner check time to build each creep to use for crap, scale with type no just magic number

Step 2 Make a room controller logic. Move all logic from spawner ( spawner should be dumb) to roomcontroller. roomcontroller should have a list of room, what type of room they are.

USE FLAGS TO ASSIGN ROOMS TO ROOMCONTROLLERS.
ALSO TO MAKE NEW ROOM CONTROLLERS.
UNQIUE PREFIX FOR THAT.

// QUESTION:
Should I have spawners keep doing logic?
NO

Implement a roomscontroller Object in memory.

What does this roomcontroller do?
ONLY SPAWN CREEPS THAT ARE NOT HAULER/HARVESTER IF ROOM IS AT FULL CAPACITY OF EXTENSIONS AND SPAWN.
  it maintains the rooms that are assigned to it.
  room maintaince level is based on current status of room? (number of extensions, number of containers, roads? towers? room level?).

    roomController.spawnCreepsIfNeeded();
      roomController.spawnHarvesters();
      etc.

    roomController.buildBuildingsIfNeeded();
      etc.

README
For current creeps.
If time remaing < time it takes to spawn that creep + travel time to that creeps location (only for harvesters? maybe not worth. actually 100% worth for harvesters, not for haulers).
Make a replacement.

on spawners, do a chest if time to finish spawning <2?
if so, if the spawning creep has a property of what creep it is being made to replace.
Recycle that creeps
(REPLACE CURRENT RECYCLE CODE WITH THIS. SMARTER.)
README


 code based on room level?
 each room is either a base room, or a satellite of a base;

 each room controller can have 1 base room, and any number of satellites.

 On claiming + spawner built, unregister room from old and add to new.

NOTE on logical progression of room.
  RCL 1
  1: make harvesters + haulers. (2 haulers per harvester) This can be as many rooms as it can handle. Manually add in rooms that make sense?
  2: make an upgrader. fill source is the spawner.
  3: make 2 builders
  4: make a container near room controller for upgrader. REMEMBER THIS CONTAINER IN ROOM CONTROLLER. ASSIGN IT TO THE UPGRADERS AS TARGET FOR FILLING.
  RCL 2
  1: make as many extensions as possible.
  2: make a container near base for builder.
  3: add in a road worker/repairer. (Same role? sure);


step 2.5

Upgraders should be assigned a container/store id on creation. they should only get energy for upgrading from this one position. spawner at start, dedicated container/storage later.
builders should be assigned a container/store id on creation. they should only fill from this position. This should start as spawner, move to container after spawn.
creep.memory.fillFromID

if said source is destroyed backup to using any.

Step 3
completely refactor all pathfinding code to actually fucking work well.

Cache path from x to y, but also
  1.store the path in creep memory.
  2.store what step on the path the creep is on?
  3.store the time that the creep has been stuck on the step for.

what happens when a path fails.
when creep tries to move,

Step 3.5
If builders have nothing to build, have them repair over upgrade. They are not optimized for room upgrading. upgraders are.

Step 4
Make a road worker. Priority last. WORK=CARRY=MOVE, MOVE > CARRY > WORK. 1 per room should be enough. other builders will help anyways.
Seperate base builder from road builders
Road builder does -
IF: Energy is empty - Fill from base.
ELSE: there are roads to be built, build them. - Find roads that are under constuction. assign targetID. assign task.build
ELSE: if there are roads to repair, repair them. Find roads that have health < maxHealth. assign targetID. task.repair
ELSE: find a cached path. From start, to finish, create roads buildings on that path. - I think I like this logic being here? one per room should be enough. task.makeRoads


step 5:

add code to roomcontroller that calculates the energy income (sources*9 per tick)
and calculates the energy expenditures - Cost of creeps that are being built/1500, cost of maintaining roads and containersToFill
Make sure that there is a surpluss of work of upgraders + work of builders/10
If there is more, add an upgrader to fill it.
Less, reduce the amount of work on upgraders.
Budgets? make sure always run surplus?
